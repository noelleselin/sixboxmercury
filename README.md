# sixboxmercury
Biogeochemical cycle model following Selin, Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry, 2014

This model is a Python implementation of the box model used in the publication:
N. E. Selin, 2014. Global Change and Mercury Cycling: Challenges for Implementing a Global Mercury Treaty. Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry, 33(6):1202-1210.

The original model used in the publication was written in Vensim. For ease of use in examining future scenarios, I have translated the timescales of this model to Python, given initial conditions as the present-day values in Selin (2014).
